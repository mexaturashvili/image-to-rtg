# image to rtg

image to rtg is a python script made for importing images into the roblox game called "road to gramby's"
the script makes the image out of painted connector blocks


to use it simply just paste the image path into the script and type width and height of the image
example:

```
image location:path/to/your/image.png
X: 60
Y: 60
```


i recommend not putting anything higher than 60X60 as it may crash the server

after you put image path, width and height in it will generate a base64 code that will be automatically copied to your clipboard

the code is now ready paste in road to gramby's
